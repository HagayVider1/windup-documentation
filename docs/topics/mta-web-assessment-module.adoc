= Assessment Module

The assessment process for applications that are to be migrated in Red Hat Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) has been separated from other tool features.

* A separate assessment hub includes the assessment module.
* Assessment supports multiple questionnaires, relevant to each assessed application.
* Default questionnaires can be customized and saved.
* User can design and version custom questionnaires and questions using YAML syntax.
* Assessed applications are grouped into *archetypes* with similar application characteristics.
* Assessment module integrates tightly with the application inventory.
* Assessment questionnaires can be imported and exported.
* Enhanced questionnaire capabilities:
** Conditional questions
** Application auto-tagging according to answers
** Automated answers from tags in application archetypes

In the MTA user interface, the Assessment Module appears in a separate menu item. Selecting the item shows the currently saved applications.

The {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) assesses applications that are to be migrated, according to a set of questions relevant to the application, such as dependencies, *[more question types]*. 
// {ProductShortName} comes with a default questionnaire/s that the user can edit, customize and save as new questionnaires.
