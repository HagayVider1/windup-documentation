= Assessing an application

The assessment process for applications that are to be migrated in {ProductFullName} has been separated from other features.

In the {ProductShortName} user interface, you can assess an application by using the Assessment module in a separate menu item. By selecting this item, you can display the currently saved applications.

The {ProductShortName} assesses applications according to a set of questions relevant to the application, such as dependencies.
