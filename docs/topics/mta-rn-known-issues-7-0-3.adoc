This part provides known issues present in {ProductFullName} version 7.0.3:

.IntelliJ IDE plugin Keymap actions do not work
// Scheduled to be fixed in 7.0.3. Move this to resolved issues once fixed?

The IntelliJ IDE plugin Keymap actions do not work which prevents the {ProductShortName} automation. Currently, there is no workaround available. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2460[(MTA-2460)]

.Eclipse IDE cannot run the {ProductShortName} analysis

// Get more information
Eclipse IDE cannot run the {ProductShortName} plugin and perform application analysis. Currently, there is no workaround available. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2563[(MTA-2563)]

.Analysis fails on MacOS
// Moved to resolved issues once fixed?

Running the `analyze` command on a MacOS machine does not work when Podman does not have enough memory. The analysis failed with timeout, without returning an error. 

Workaround: Set Podman memory to at least 4GB. Podman on MacOS sets default memory to 2GB, which is not enough to run {ProductShortName}. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2518[(MTA-2518)]

.Custom rules do not work
// Need more information. I don't really understand what is happening.

Running an analysis using a custom rule does not work. The link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2015[(MTA-2015)]

.`Applications` page loads slowly when there are many applications
// Any more information?

When the Application Inventory has to list many applications, the page loads slowly. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2497[(MTA-2497)]

.Tests fail when the `output.yaml` file is saved to a different directory than the default
// Copied to Resolved issues.

When running a CLI command to analyze an application, the analysis requires saving the `output.yaml` file only in the default directory. Setting the analysis to save to a different directory causes the analysis to fail and return an error. list:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2654[(MTA-2654)]
