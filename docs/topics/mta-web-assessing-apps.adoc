= Assessing an application by using the MTA assessment questionnaire

The assessment process for applications that are to be migrated in {ProductFullName} has been separated from other features. In the {ProductShortName} user interface, you can assess an application and display the currently saved assessments by using the Assessment module.

The {ProductShortName} assesses applications according to a set of questions relevant to the application, such as dependencies.

You can use the default Legacy Pathfinder {ProductFullName} questionnaire to determine the risks involved in containerizing an application before reviewing the application. For more information, see xref:mta-default-questionnaire_user-interface-guide[The default assessment questionnaire].

IMPORTANT: You can assess only one application at a time.
