= Assessing applications

You can use the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} to determine the risks involved in containerizing an application.

[NOTE]
====
The procedure described below uses a built-in questionnaire for assessing the risks involved in containerizing an application. By default, this procedure is required prior to reviewing the application. However, you might want to skip this step and use your own questionnaire instead. In that case, use the Skipping assessment option.
