= Creating custom migration targets

Architects or users with `admin` permissions can create and maintain custom rulesets associated with custom migration targets. Architects can upload custom rule files and assign them to various custom migration targets. The custom migration targets are then available for selecting in the analysis configuration wizard.

Using ready-made custom migration targets makes unnecessary the cumbersome task of configuring custom rules for each analysis run. This simplifies analysis configuration and execution for non-admin users or third-party developers and makes using {ProductShortName} easier and more straightforward.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. In *Administration* view, click *Custom migration targets*.

.Set custom target

. In the upper-left corner of the main pane, select the application language.
+
[NOTE]
====
{ProductShortName} currently only supports Java. Go is available as a _Technology Preview_ feature.
====
+
. If you selected *Java*, under *Application server migration to* select *JBoss EAP 7* or *JBoss EAP 8*.
. Click *Create new*.
. Enter the name and description of the target.
. In the *Image* section, upload an image file for the target's icon. The file can be in either PNG or JPEG format, up to 1 MB, and then click *Upload*. The application uses a default icon if you do not upload any file.
. In the *Custom rules* section, select either *Upload manually* or *Retrieve from a repository*.
** If you have selected *Upload manually*, upload or drag the required rule files from your local drive.
** If you have selected *Retrieve from a repository*, proceed as follows:
... Choose *Git* or *Subversion*.
... Enter *Source repository*, *Branch* and *Root path*.
... If the repository requires credentials, enter them in the *Associated credentials* field.
. Click *Create*.
+
The new migration target appears on the *Custom migration targets* page. Non-admin users can now use it in *Migration* view.
