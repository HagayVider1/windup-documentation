= Creating custom migration targets

Architects or users with `admin` permissions can create and maintain custom rulesets associated with custom migration targets. Architects can upload custom rule files and assign them to various custom migration targets. The custom migration targets are then available for selecting in the analysis configuration wizard.

Using ready-made custom migration targets makes unnecessary the cumbersome task of configuring custom rules for each analysis run. This simplifies analysis configuration and execution for non-admin users or third-party developers and makes using the {ProductShortName} tool easier and more straightforward.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `admin` permissions.

. In the *Custom rules* section, select either *Upload manually* or *Retrieve from a repository*.
** If you have selected *Upload manually*, upload or drag and drop the required rule files from your local drive.
** If you have selected *Retrieve from a repository*, proceed as follows:
... Choose *Git* or *Subversion*.
... Fill in *Source repository*, *Branch* and *Root path*.

The new migration target appears on the *Custom migration targets* page. It can now be used by non-admin users in *Migration* view.
