{ProductName}({ProductShortName}) includes a feature that groups applications that are assessed for migration according to common characteristics. These application groups, or *archetypes*, enable {ProductShortName} to apply questionnaires with questions that apply to common application characteristics.

Application *archetypes* are defined by criteria tags and the application taxonomy. Each archetype selects how the _assessment module_ assesses the applications according to the characteristics defined in that archetype.
