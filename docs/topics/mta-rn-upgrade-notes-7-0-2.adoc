The following are upgrade notes for {ProductFullName}

.Upgrade from {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 to {ProductShortName} 7.0.2


.Hub database volume size

In version 7.0.2 of {ProductShortName}, the default size of the hub database volume has been increased to 10GiB.

If your storage class does not support volume expansion, then an upgrade from 6.2.1 to 7.0.2 will result in a failure due to the operator trying to change the volume size from 5GiB to 10GiB.

To avoid this issue, you can directly set the volume size by setting:

[source,yaml]
----
...
hub_database_volume_size: 5Gi
...
----

By doing this, you will avoid the operator trying to resize the volume.

If this value was set when the previous version was deployed, there is no need to take any action, as it will work as expected.
