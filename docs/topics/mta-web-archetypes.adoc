[id="mta-archetypes_{context}"]
= Archetypes

{ProductName}({ProductShortName}) includes a feature that groups applications that you are assessing for migration according to common characteristics. These application groups, or *archetypes*, enable {ProductShortName} to apply questionnaires with questions that apply to common application characteristics.

Criteria tags and the application taxonomy define application *archetypes*. Each archetype selects the how the _assessment module_ assesses the applications according to the characteristics defined in that archetype. Applications automatically associate with archetypes that have the same tags. Each archetype shows the applications associated to it. You can also duplicate an archetype and then edit its name, tags, stakeholders, and metadata.

:_content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="mta-review-archetype_{context}"]
== To review the migration plan for an archetype

You can define the review process for all the applications associated with an archetype. You can only review a single application at a time, but with archetypes you can review all the applications associated with the archetype together. This procedure is the same to xref:mta-web-reviewing-apps[Reviewing applications], but applies to all the applications associated with the archetype. 

.Procedure

. In *Migration* view, click *Archetypes*.
. Select the archetype whose applications you want to review.
. For the archetype that you want to review, click the `options` icon {kebab} at the right end of the archetype row.
. Select *Review* from the drop-down list, opening the *Review* dialog for the archetype.
. Click *Proposed action* and select an action to perform on the applications in the archetype.
. Click *Effort estimate* and select how much effort you expect to invest to prepare the applications for migration.
. Set a value of `1` to `10` for *Business criticality* for the applications, where 1 is low criticality and 10 is high.
. Set a value of `1` to `10` for *Work priority* for the applications, where 1 is low priority and 10 is high.
. Enter free text into the *Comments* field. (optional)
. Click *Submit review*.

The fields from *Review* are now populated on the *Archetype* page.
